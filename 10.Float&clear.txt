	<h1><center><u>Float Property</u></center></h1>
		<p>The float property is used for positioning and formatting content e.g. let an image float left to the text in a container.<br>
			The float property can have one of the following values:<br>
			<b>
			<li>left - The element floats to the left of its container</li>
			<li>right - The element floats to the right of its container</li>
			<li>none - The element does not float (will be displayed just where it occurs in the text). This is default</li>
			<li>inherit - The element inherits the float value of its parent</li></b>
			In its simplest use, the float property can be used to wrap text around images.</p>
		<p id="syntax">The syntax for the float property was:<br>
				selector{<br>
					float:left(or)right(or)none(or)inheriet;<br>
					}<br>

		<p>BY using the no float the text will be on default</p><hr><hr>





	<h2 id="three"><u>Clear Property:</u></h2
			<p>When we use the float property, and we want the next element below (not on right or left), we will have to use the clear property.
			The clear property specifies what should happen with the element that is next to a floating element.
			The clear property can have one of the following values:<br>
				<b>
				<li>none - The element is not pushed below left or right floated elements. This is default</li>
				<li>left - The element is pushed below left floated elements</li>
				<li>right - The element is pushed below right floated elements</li>
				<li>both - The element is pushed below both left and right floated elements.</li>
				<li>inherit - The element inherits the clear value from its parent.</li></p></b><hr><hr>
